# DesignByContract2 - Cristian Nita

I added OpenJML checkups in Bank.java, but they still don't work(and I added the proper libraries from http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/installation.shtml#installation ). You can check Bank.java, the only place I tried them.

tried resources:

http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/checks.shtml

later update:

seems to work to be installed in Eclipse, but I couldn't make it work there neither.
